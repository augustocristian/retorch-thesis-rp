# Replication package for the thesis "Resource Characterization and Optimization for End-to-End Testing"

This repository contains the replication package of the thesis Resource Characterization and Optimization for End-to-End Testing

The replication package comprises the test scripts, Jenkinsfiles and configuration files used during the evaluation revision of the Chapter IV. The replication package is organized as follows:

## CHAPTER IV: RETORCH â€“ End-to-End optimization through the smart characterization of the resources Evaluation.

Located in `/chapterIV` folder contains all the evaluation data and scripting of this chapter. The folder is composed by  three different subfolders

- `/chapterIV/jenkinsfiles`: contains the Jenkinsfiles of the different execution plans: [baseline](chapterIV/jenkinsfiles/Jenkinsfile_baseline), [sequential](chapterIV/jenkinsfiles/Jenkinsfile_sequential), [3-parallel](chapterIV/jenkinsfiles/Jenkinsfile_3parallel), [4-parallel](chapterIV/jenkinsfiles/Jenkinsfile_4parallel),  and the [RETORCH](chapterIV/jenkinsfiles/Jenkinsfile_RETORCH).
- `/chapterIV/envfiles` contains the  `.env` files used to deploy the SUTS in the [RETORCH's  schedullings](chapterIV/envfiles/retorch/) and the [baseline](chapterIV/envfiles/baseline)
- `/chapterIV/monitoring` contains the docker-compose to deploy and monitor the SUT as well as the python scripting to convert the prometheus API output to a Excel-format compatible output.


### Monitoring

The monitorization of the E2E test suite execution is done through prometheus and CAdvisor. After the execution plan is executed, we got the memory and processor usage thrrough the prometheus API with the following requests:
#### Memory:
```url
http://[URL]:[PORT]/api/v1/query_range?query=rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{id="/"}[1m])&start=[STARTUNIXTIME]&end=[ENDUNIXTIME]&step=1
```
#### Processor:
```url
http://[URL]:[PORT]/api/v1/query_range?query=container_memory_usage_bytes{id="/"}/1024/1024/1024&start=[STARTUNIXTIME]&end=[ENDUNIXTIME]&step=1
```
